Make a MVP for this kind of tool that would integrate with local wandb runs (and ideally online also) 

# tagline 
Query is an AI-powered experiment management platform that helps ML researchers analyze metrics, code diffs, and results to cluster runs, generate insights, and suggest next steps. Today’s platforms only track data; ours understands it.

#vision 
We’re building fully autonomous AI agents capable of performing independent research in Machine Learning and Data Science. Our vision is to create AI systems that can independently propose hypotheses, design experiments, execute them, analyze results, and iterate—pushing the boundaries of scientific discovery without human intervention.
Modern ML research is becoming unmanageable. Researchers must run hundreds of experiments, track countless metrics, correlate code changes with performance improvements, and synthesize insights from an ever-expanding literature. The bottleneck isn’t compute—it’s human attention and analysis capacity.



# Our company
We are building a fully autonomous AI agent to perform research in ML and Data Science. To achieve this we will first build an AI-first experiment management platform: i.e. Cursor for Weights&Biasesm. We will start with an experiment management platform to assist ML researchers in analyzing the results of the experiments, looking into the code diffs, building visualization and evaluating hypotheses. Over time, we’ll expand features: such as suggestion of new hypotheses, experiments, literature review etc. Gradually moving towards our ultimate vision: a fully autonomous AI researcher that can independently propose and test hypotheses.

We are building fully autonomous AI agents to perform research in ML and Data Science. Data required to train such agents is scarce, thus we are building tools to assist in ML research to collect the data and create fully autonomous research agent. Our first product – an AI-powered experiment management platform (i.e. Cursor for Weights and Biases) that helps ML researchers analyze their runs, intelligently cluster them and extract insights. Our AI analyzes the code diffs, experiment results and key metrics to provide research insights. Current experiment management platforms missing this key functionality, which makes it hard for researchers to navigate hundreds of experiments and code versions.

We’re building an AI that can autonomously conduct ML research. Data required for the agents to be able to come up with hypothesis and iterate on them, while avoiding mode collapse is scarce. This is why we are starting by building Query – AI-powered experiment management platform—think Cursor for Weights & Biases. It helps researchers make sense of their experiments by analyzing code diffs, metrics, and results to cluster runs, generate research insights, and suggest next steps. Today’s platforms only track data; ours understands it. Query not only accelerates ML research but is a necessary step towards fully autonomous research agents.
